# Computer Programming & Datamanagement - 2

During my exchange studies in Italy, from 2024 November to 2025 January, I attended this course, which was an extension of [3. Computer Programming & Data Management - 1](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-3/1.%20Exchange%20Studies%20Venice/3.%20Computer%20Programming%20&%20Datamanagement%20-%201?ref_type=heads). It covered Python Programming, ranging from OOP, vectorized operations in Numpy, dataframe manipulation in Pandas and data visualization in Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn. At the end of the course, me and two other students were assigned a bigger project. The task was to visualize different aspects that relates to a main theme, to highlight important patterns and meaningful insights about the society. In particular, we choosed *US elections between 2000-2020* as the field of research. Furthermore, we decomposed this broad notion into the different subtopics of *Economic*, *Political* and *Social* aspects about the population and their voting patterns favoring either Republicans or Democrats.

This directory is divided into two subdirectories:

- **lecture-practices:** *Practices from lectures involving Classes & Objects, Numpy, Pandas, Timeframes and visualization libraries*

- **submission:** *The final product or result of project where all learning lessons from the course are used to produce business value and insights. In particular, the `.pdf` file is the Canva Presentation and the `.ipynb` is the code submission*
