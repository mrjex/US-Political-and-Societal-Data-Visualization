Our team decomposed American voting behavior into three aspects:
- **Economic factors** influencing voter preferences
- **Political trends** across presidential elections
- **Social demographics** and their correlation with party affiliation


## Developed Visualizations

Our analysis produced several revealing visualizations that highlight the complex relationships between various factors and voting patterns:

### Economic Indicators
