## Overview

During my exchange studies in Venice, Italy (November 2024 - January 2025), I participated in an advanced data science course focusing on Python programming and data visualization techniques. This repository contains the culmination of that work: a comprehensive analysis of US electoral patterns from 2000-2020.

Our team decomposed American voting behavior into three interconnected dimensions:
- **Economic factors** influencing voter preferences
- **Political trends** across presidential elections
- **Social demographics** and their correlation with party affiliation


## Project Highlights

- **Data Processing**: Leveraged Pandas for cleaning and transforming multiple datasets
- **Advanced Visualization**: Created insightful charts using Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied numerical techniques to identify significant patterns
- **Multidimensional Approach**: Examined voting behavior through economic, political, and social lenses

The complete project presentation and code are available in the `/submission` directory:
- `Python Boys Presentation.pdf`: Canva presentation with data insights
- `*.ipynb` files: Jupyter notebooks containing all analysis code
- Datasets used for each visualization

## Developed Visualizations

Our analysis produced several revealing visualizations that highlight the complex relationships between various factors and voting patterns:
