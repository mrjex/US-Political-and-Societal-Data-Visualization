# US Political & Societal Data Visualization

During my exchange studies in Italy, from 2024 November to 2025 January, I attended this course. It covered Python Programming, ranging from OOP, vectorized operations in Numpy, dataframe manipulation in Pandas and data visualization in Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn. At the end of the course, me and two other students were assigned a bigger project. The task was to visualize different aspects that relates to a main theme, to highlight important patterns and meaningful insights about the society. In particular, we choosed *US elections between 2000-2020* as the field of research. Furthermore, we decomposed this broad notion into the different subtopics of *Economic*, *Political* and *Social* aspects about the population and their voting patterns favoring either Republicans or Democrats.

The developed artifacts can be found in `/submission`, and it encompasses a *.pdf* file for the Canva presentation, where deduductions from data visualizations are made. In addition the corresponding `.ipynb` file with the code for each data representation and along with each and every dataset is included in this directory.
